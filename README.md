# TFQuake

HOW TO PLAY:
Each team has a capture point (flag used as a placeholder since I couldn't get my models into the engine). The first team to capture the other team's control point wins. I had a map with one capture point in the middle, and I found it more fun because it got everyone into a giant team fight, but then I realized you asked for two CP's.
